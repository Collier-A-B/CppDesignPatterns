# Bridge Design Pattern

Addresses the "exploding class hierarchies" phenomenon

- idea is to seperate common/specific parts of a design into distinct hierarchies
- Illustrated in bridge_01.png -> bridge_02.png
- Uses composition to bridge the two hierarchies instead of creating an inheritance relationship
for each type of element with and each style
