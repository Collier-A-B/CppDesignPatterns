# CppDesignPatterns

LinkedIn Learning Course on design patterns in C++

## Repository Structure

each directory corresponds to a section of the LinkedIn Course, and all notes and code
for each section are located within the corresponding directory

e.g.: All Code relating to Adapter Design pattern can be found within ../Adapter/

## Running and Compiling Code

To compile a *.cpp file: `g++ -o */ouput_file_name */source_file_name`

- the `*/` designates the relative path to the file from the cwd of your terminal(root of repo by default)
- you can change the relative path to the output file if you want to save it to a different location

To run a executable: `*/output_file_name` for mac/linux
